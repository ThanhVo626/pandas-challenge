# pandas-challenge
I'm turning this in late because after class I tried to install a new cpu and I was having problems installing and troubleshooting it.
So I couldn't get on my computer to make final adjustments and turn in the assignment on time.
I apologize and hope that this still counts and can turn it in.

Overall the challenge wasn't too difficult but more so tedious and a lot of small simple code.
I did a lot of copypasting from the starter code, not sure if this was what I was suppose to do but i was able to get some results
I wasn't always sure if I was on the right track because unlike the previous assingments there wasn't a result images I could compare to see if I was getting what I needed
I didn't use outside sources to help with the code, I mainly had to sift through a lot of the assignments we went over in class to find the proper code I needed.
Not much to comment on my code because the starter code gave us a guideline and prewritten comments on what we needed to do.
