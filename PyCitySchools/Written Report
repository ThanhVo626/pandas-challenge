We cannot conclude too much from the district summary besides that students perform better in reading with a 85% pass rate than math at 75%. However pass both seems to be quite low with a measly 65%. Its hard to pull any overall conclusions from the school summary as well. However it would be useful when you would need to compare schools directly with each other. We also see that the bottom 5 schools are all district types meanwhile the top 5 are all charter types in terms of Overall Pass Rate.

From grade to grade, there doesn't seem to be any significant changes or anything that seems to stand out. Across all four grades, the pass rates seem to be consistent.

With the spending summary we see that there is a inverse relationship between spending cost per student and overall pass rate. The schools that have a high pass rate seem to have a low spending per student. The size summary shows that small and medium schools outperform large size schools by a significant amount. Large schools have a 58% pass rate meanwhile small and medium size schools have a 90% pass rate. Using the type summary we might be able to understand the reason behind that. Charter schools have a 90% pass rate and district schools have a 54% pass rate. Charter schools are more likely to have a smaller school size and district schools have a high school size which may be the reason why our data looks the way they do. However there is a large sized charter school that still maintains a 90% pass rate. With all the information we have available we can conclude that charter schools are more successful than districts schools even though they have lower budgets.
